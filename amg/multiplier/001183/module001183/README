  mult.vhd:   multiplier in VHDL
  mult.v:     multiplier in Verilog-HDL
  mult_dc.v:  multiplier in Verilog-HDL, which is optimized for 
              Design Compiler (Synopsys, Inc.) using GTECH Library.

  "mult.vhd", "mult.v", and "mult_dc.v" contain the same content with different
  file formats.

  Each HDL file contains the design information (top module name and 
  user-defined specification) in the header.


Tips
----
  The generated module is optimized to implement the hardware algorithm.  
  So, "logic optimization" is not always effective for improving the circuit 
  performance.  In the case of Design Compiler, you should use the option
  "-only_design_rule" to obtain better results.

  Command example on dc_shell
    > compile -only_design_rule
